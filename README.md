# GitHub Foundations Certification

* To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the hierarchy level and typeface size of the heading.
* You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ).
* You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with -, *, or +.
* To order your list, precede each line with a number.
* You can tell GitHub to hide content from the rendered Markdown by placing the content in an HTML comment.
* Use ** ** or __ __ to rendered a line as bold in a Markdown.
* Anyone with admin permissions to a repository can make the repository a template.
* A Codespace's lifecycle begins when you create it and ends when you delete it. You can disconnect and reconnect to an active Codespace without affecting its running processes, and you can stop and restart a Codespace without losing any changes you've made to your project. Hence, the Codespace lifecycle can be broadly categorized into these four stages:
  1. Creating a Codespace
  2. Rebuilding a Codespace
  3. Closing or stopping a Codespace
  4. Deleting a Codespace
* The primary states for a file in a Git repository are:
  1. **Untracked**: An initial state of a file when it isn't yet part of the Git repository. Git is unaware of its existence.
  2. **Tracked**: A tracked file is one that Git is actively monitoring. It can be in one of the following substates:
     1. **Unmodified**: The file is tracked, but it hasn't been modified since the last commit.
     2. **Modified**: The file has been changed since the last commit, but these changes aren't yet staged for the next commit.
     3. **Staged**: The file has been modified, and the changes have been added to the staging area (also known as the index). These changes are ready to be committed.
     4. **Committed**: The file is in the repository's database. It represents the latest committed version of the file.
* You can use a saved reply to respond to an issue or pull request.
Saved replies allow you to create a reusable response to issues and pull requests. Saved replies are tied to your personal account. Once they're created, you'll be able to use them across repositories and organizations. You can create a maximum of 100 saved replies. If you've reached the maximum limit, you can delete saved replies that you no longer use or edit existing saved replies. You can also use the GitHub-provided "Duplicate issue" saved reply to mark an issue as a duplicate and track it with a similar issue.
* People with triage permission to a repository can create an issue from a discussion. When you create an issue from a discussion, the contents of the discussion post will be automatically included in the issue body, and any labels will be retained. Creating an issue from a discussion does not convert the discussion to an issue or delete the existing discussion.
* If you create a wiki in a private repository, only people with access to the repository can access the wiki.
* You can change name, VM, IDE and shell of a codespace.
* The github.dev editor opens instantly with a key-press and allows users to start editing code right away, without having to wait for additional configuration or installation. This makes it more convenient for quick edits or tasks compared to GitHub Codespaces.
* Workflows are defined in the **.github/workflows** directory in yaml files.
* To search for issues and pull requests in all repositories owned by a certain organization, you can use the "org" qualifier. To search for issues and pull requests in a specific repository, you can use the "repo" qualifier.
* When the CODEOWNERS file exceeds the size limit of 3 MB, GitHub won't load the file, and the code owner information won't be displayed. To address this issue, Peter should optimize the CODEOWNERS file size by consolidating multiple entries into a single entry using wildcard patterns
* Git is an example of a distributed version control system (DVCS). In DVCS, each user has a complete copy of the repository, enabling decentralized and flexible collaboration.
* To give people instructions for reporting security vulnerabilities in your project, you can add a SECURITY.md file to your repository's root, docs, or .github folder. When someone creates an issue in your repository, they will see a link to your project's security policy.
* Users can access all the repositories and topics they have starred on GitHub by visiting their stars page at https://github.com/stars. This page allows users to search, sort, and filter their starred content.
* Insights for Projects on GitHub allows users with write or admin access to a project to view, create, and customize charts based on the project's data.
* You can use the involves qualifier to find issues that in some way involve a certain user. The involves qualifier is a logical OR between the author, assignee, mentions, and commenter qualifiers for a single user.
* Use the git revert <SHA> command to undo the mistaken commit.
* If you create a new repository under your account in the future, do not reuse the original name of the renamed repository. If you do, redirects to the renamed repository will no longer work.
* If a repository contains more than one README file, then the file shown is chosen from locations in the following order: the .github directory, then the repository's root directory, and finally the docs directory.
* Peter should name his new public repository on GitHub as "username.github.io," where "username" is his actual GitHub username or organization name. If the first part of the repository doesn’t exactly match your username, it won’t work, so make sure to get it right.
* Users with write access to a repository can assign issues and pull requests.
* A repository admin can view insights for a repository in the "Insights" tab, located at the top of the repository's page on GitHub.
* GitHub maintains the visibility of topic names as public, regardless of whether they are created within private repositories.
* GitHub slash commands are shortcuts or commands that enable users to perform various actions directly from the comment box or issue description by using a forward slash ("/") followed by a keyword or action
* External collaborators cannot be team maintainers.
* 2FA -> SMS, Authentication App, Security Key and GitHub Mobile.
* Label
